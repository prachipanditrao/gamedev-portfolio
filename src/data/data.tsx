This achievement was made possible through the creation of "Ludo All Star," a captivating Parcheesi game offering engaging gameplay for two to four players on a shared board.
    This project involved a rich blend of technologies, including the CocosCreator Game Engine, Javascript, TypeScript, C++, Python, Android Java, and iOS Xcode ObjectiveC, culminating in a thrilling and globally beloved gaming experience.
    In this project, I played a pivotal role in client-side development, using JavaScript and TypeScript, and created scripting tools to streamline the development process. Utilizing Python, I generated Android projects and employed regular expressions to craft Android gradle files, manifests, and other project details. Additionally, I wrote custom code in Java and Objective C, leveraging platform-specific features, including ad implementation, analytical events, purchases, achievements, notifications scheduling, and crash fixes. Furthermore, I contributed to enhancing the game engine in C++ and Java, particularly focusing on improvements to the sound manager and touch events.
